Data Scientist & Analytics Engineer

EDUCATION

King's College London | Sept 2024 – Sept 2025
MSc in Robotics (Merit)
Relevant modules: Machine Learning; Neural Networks & Deep Learning; Systems & Control; Robot Kinematics; Sensing & Perception.

City, University of London | Sept 2020 – May 2024
BEng in Mechanical Engineering (Upper second-class honours)

RESEARCH & ACADEMIC PROJECTS

AI-Powered Investment Decision Support for UK Care Homes | Sept 2024 – Sept 2025
Master's Thesis
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline on UK public datasets (ONS, CQC, Land Registry): ingestion, cleaning, reconciliation, feature engineering, and modelling.
- Trained and evaluated models (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost) and produced decision-ready outputs with clear validation and sensitivity checks.
- Delivered an interactive Streamlit dashboard with explainability (SHAP/LIME) and LLM-driven Q&A to communicate insights to non-technical users.

Engineers Without Borders MSc Project | Oct 2024 – May 2025
IoT Water Station for Rural Communities
- Designed a data-informed service concept for a solar-powered IoT water kiosk; translated stakeholder needs into measurable requirements and system KPIs.
- Built cost and operating assumptions to compare design options; presented trade-offs clearly to support group decisions under time constraints.
- Evaluated sustainability impacts using LCA and systems thinking; produced concise visuals and recommendations for a non-technical audience.

International Conference Paper | Sept 2024 – Sept 2025
"Evaluating Compressor Selection and Performance in High-Temperature Heat Pump Systems for Industrial Applications"
- Developed and validated models against empirical data; produced publication-quality results quantifying efficiency and reliability trade-offs.
- Compared configurations (single-/two-stage, cascade) and synthesised findings into defensible recommendations for industrial applications.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Kirfu | Dec 2023 – June 2025
Technical Analyst (AI-Logistics Start-Up)
- Supported last-mile optimisation work using geospatial and operational data; cleaned datasets, defined KPIs, and delivered weekly insight summaries for stakeholders.
- Improved reliability of recurring Python analyses by standardising inputs, debugging scripts, and documenting assumptions to make outputs repeatable.
- Conducted and synthesised 50+ driver interviews into a quantified operational case for funding; contributed to securing £4,500 from the City Star Project.

Royal Mail | Feb 2022 – Jan 2025
Delivery Driver
- Maintained a 97% completion rate while operating under time and quality constraints; prioritised workload dynamically across high-volume routes.
- Trained and mentored 10 new starters, improving on-boarding speed and reducing operational errors through clear process guidance.
- Introduced route planning habits that reduced wasted travel and improved daily throughput during peak periods.

Haya Community Centre | Apr 2018 – Present
Community Volunteer
- Planned and delivered community events; coordinated logistics and communicated with diverse groups to ensure safe, well-run sessions.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the [ROLE] at [COMPANY]. I hold a BEng in Mechanical Engineering and I am completing an MSc in Robotics at King's College London. Across my academic and professional experience, I have developed a strong analytical foundation, with a growing focus on how data can be used to evaluate performance and support decision-making.

Through my recent work on an investment-focused project, I developed a strong interest in how businesses are assessed and how value is created in practice. Working with large UK datasets, I analysed regional performance, identified key drivers, and translated data into clear insights to support decision-making.

Alongside my academic work, my experience at an AI logistics start-up further strengthened my ability to work with real-world data and operational challenges. I analysed delivery performance, identified inefficiencies, and supported the development of optimisation strategies, contributing to improved decision-making and a successful funding proposal.

I am keen to contribute, learn from experienced professionals, and gain hands-on exposure in this field. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Essa Abikar
